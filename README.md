# A-Safe-Invironment-For-Our-Little-Ones



Child abuse or child maltreatment is physical, sexual, and/or psychological maltreatment or neglect of a child or children, especially by a parent or a caregiver. Child abuse may include any act or failure to act by a parent or a caregiver that results in actual or potential harm to a child and can occur in a child's home, or in the organizations, schools, or communities the child interacts with.
In recent years we are hearing about more and more cases of abuse mainly in nurseries. The main reason for this is the lack of institutional supervision. In 2020 a law has been enacted to prevent these cases, and the law includes, among other things, the installation of cameras in kindergartens and nurseries, although it does not solve the problem of abuse because the viewers of the security cameras (parents of the children) do not have time to sit for 8 hours a day and stare at what is happening. 
For this reason we decided to build a system that would help to detect child abuse using specific sounds of infant cries. The system will listen and identify if a child is in distress using data from this equipment.

When our system detects that the child is in distress, it will send a notification to the parents via a mobile app about a video that was taken recently through the system. The parents can see if this video contains child abuse content.
